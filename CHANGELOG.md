- [CVE-2024-29021](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/security/advisories/GHSA-q7vg-26pg-v5hr)

## Deployment Procedure
Judge0 is collecting telemetry data to help improve the product and understand its use in various production environments. Read more about telemetry [here](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/blob/v1.13.1/TELEMETRY.md).

#### System Requirements
Please note that Judge0 has only been tested on **Linux** and might not work on other systems; thus, we do not provide support for it.

We recommend using Ubuntu 22.04, on which you need to do the following update of GRUB:
1. Use `sudo` to open file `/etc/default/grub`
2. Add `systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0` in the value of `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` variable.
   
	*Example `/etc/default/grub` file*
	```
	GRUB_DEFAULT=0
	GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden
	GRUB_TIMEOUT=0
	GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`
	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quite splash"
	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0"
	```

3. Apply the changes: `sudo update-grub`
4. Restart your server: `sudo reboot`

Additionally, make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) installed.

#### Deployment Steps
1. Download and extract the release archive:
```
wget https://github.com/judge0/judge0/releases/download/v1.13.1/judge0-v1.13.1.zip
unzip judge0-v1.13.1.zip
```

2. Visit [this website](https://www.random.org/passwords/?num=1&len=32&format=plain&rnd=new) to generate a random password.
3. Use the generated password to update the variable `REDIS_PASSWORD` in the `judge0.conf` file.
4. Visit again [this website](https://www.random.org/passwords/?num=1&len=32&format=plain&rnd=new) to generate another random password.
5. Use the generated password to update the variable `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in the `judge0.conf` file.
6. Run all services and wait a few seconds until everything is initialized:
```
cd judge0-v1.13.1
docker-compose up -d db redis
sleep 10s
docker-compose up -d
sleep 5s
```
7. Your instance of Judge0 CE v1.13.1 is now up and running; visit docs at `http://<IP ADDRESS OF YOUR SERVER>:2358/docs`.


# v1.13.0 (2021-03-10)
Huge thanks to [**Filtered**](https://www.filtered.ai) for sponsoring this release.

## New Features
- Added support for `enable_network` configuration flag. With the new `ALLOW_ENABLE_NETWORK` configuration variable, usage of this flag can be permitted or denied. Furthermore, with the new `ENABLE_NETWORK` configuration variable the default value of this flag can be set for every submission.
    - Commits: [@62a00520](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/commit/62a00520692c2b7a8bf0f54528aee8fbbf864f36)
- Added `USE_DOCS_AS_HOMEPAGE` configuration variable, which allows you to show or hide Judge0 homepage. **Now, by default, Judge0 homepage is empty** and does not show the API documentation. However, you can still access the API documentation via `/docs`.
    - Issues: [#257](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/issues/257)

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed the bug where the wrong number of workers would be reported via `/workers`.
	- Issues: [#256](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/issues/256)

## Security Fixes
- **HIGH** Fixed a security bug where certain submission configuration settings would allow the user to run a program that would run infinetly long. With this fix `wall_time_limit` **must** be at least 1 second.
	- Commits: [@fce8d97a](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/commit/fce8d97ae765e87c4584115fcb73bd288d64d815)

# v1.12.0 (2020-10-18)
## New Features
- Added support for invalidating statistics cache using the `invalidate_cache` query parameter.
    - Commits: [@561c2a30](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/commit/561c2a309d98680801628fc2d79ea17e885e1d66)
- Added rake task `judge0:run_in_queue` to manually run submissions that might have stuck in the `In Queue` state.
    - Commits: [@c3b87d23](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/commit/c3b87d232a8e922b5ae04f5afdb12fc49b2ec003)
- Added support for specifying `CALLBACKS_MAX_TRIES` and `CALLBACKS_TIMEOUT`. This is a global configuration that applies to all submissions that have defined webhooks (HTTP callbacks).
    - Commits: [@c4bb76ec](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/commit/c4bb76ec866bce6b07bd733391291e720f40ef96)
- Added support for submission caching to reduce the number of unnecessary database hits. Cache duration can be controlled with the `SUBMISSION_CACHE_DURATION` variable which is currently set to 1 second by default. Submissions are only cached for `GET /submissions/<token>` route. Cache files are written to the server's file system and are automatically cleared every day at midnight. This is the first step toward more serious submission caching in the future.

# v1.10.0 (2020-07-27)
## New Features
- Added support for multi-file programs in the terms of adding a new special language called **Multi-file program**. In total there are now **47 active languages**.

|ID|Name|Note|
|---|---|---|
|89|Multi-file program||

Multi-file programs allow you specify your own compilation and execution scripts that Judge0 will use.

To use multi-file program feature you need to choose a language called *Multi-file program* whoose ID is **89**. Moreover, you need to send all program files with `additional_files` attribute. With multi-file programs attribute `source_code` cannot be used, i.e. all files should be sent with `additional_files` attribute.

For the Judge0 to know how to compile and execute your multi-file program you need to provide two special files that should be available in the root of the `.zip` archive that you are sending with `additional_files` attribute. These files should be named `compile` and `run`, and are expected to be Bash scripts that know how to compile and execute your multi-file program. If your multi-file program does not need compilation step, then you don't need to provide `compile` script. Take a look at [this example](https://github.com/judge0/examples/tree/master/cpp-project-01) to learn how to use this feature to compile and run multi-file C++ project that uses CMake.

# v1.2.2 (2019-09-07)
## Securty Fixes
- Fixed a bug that allowed anybody to read `judge0-api.conf` file. This bug was introduced in version [v1.2.1](https://github.com/judge0/api/releases/tag/v1.2.1) when config was mounted into container. With this fix, config is still mounted into container but not in `/usr/src/api` folder but rather in `/`. Root folder is not binded in isolate sandbox, whereas `/usr/src/api` is.

# v1.1.1 (2019-02-13)
## Bug Fixes
- Fixed a problem when `strip` method was called on a `nil` class when expected output was `nil`.
  - Commits: [@b25153e9](https://github.com/judge0/api/commit/b25153e9450569c995e8f3afe036fed4ad58726c)

## Other Changes
- Don't let worker update submission's `finished_at` attribute if it already exists. This allows Judge0 API administrators to manually rerun submissions from command line and preserve initial timestamps if some unexpected error occured.
